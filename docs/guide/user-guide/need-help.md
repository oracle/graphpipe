# Need Help?

With OCCA still being pretty new, lots of questions can come up from first-time programmers that might not be covered in these docs

There is no better feedback than that of a first-time user, so feel free to reach out

?> Even if it's just a question, feel free to open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues) to start a conversation!
