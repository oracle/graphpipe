# GraphPipe

> A Standardized, Efficient protocol for Dead Simple ML Model Serving

# What is it?
GraphPipe is a protocol and collection of software designed to
simplify machine learning model deployment and decouple it from
vendor-specific model implementations.

# Features
* A simple, minimalist specification based on Flatbuffers
* Simple, reference model servers for Tensorflow, Caffe2, and ONNX.  More
  implementations to come.
* Efficient client implementations in Go, Python, and Java.
