# GraphPipe

> Dead Simple Machine Learning Model Serving via a Standard Protocol

# What is it?

GraphPipe is a protocol and collection of software designed to
simplify machine learning model deployment and decouple it from
vendor-specific model implementations.

# Features

* A minimalist specification based on Flatbuffers
* Simple, reference model servers for Tensorflow, Caffe2, and ONNX.
* Efficient client implementations in Go, Python, and Java.
